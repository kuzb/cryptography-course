- Homework 3:
    - Topics: AES and irreducible polynomials, Rainbow Tables, Deterministic RSA, Probabilistic RSA.

- Homework 4:
    - ElGamal.py, DSA.py, RSA_OAEP.py were given by assignment
    - Topics: RSA-OAEP, EGamal, Kerberos, RSA signature (forward secrecy) 

- Project:
    + Step 1:
        - PhaseI_test.py, pubparams.txt, TestSet.txt, transactions.txt were given by assignment
        - DS.py: includes functions for signing given any message and verifying the signature
        - Tx.py: includes functions for generating a random Blockchain transaction
    + Step 2:
        - block_sample.txt, PhaseII_Test.py, pubparams.txt, transactions_sample.txt were given by the assingment
        - DS.py: It is same as previous step
        - Tx.py: Can generated requested number of transactions
        - PoW.py: includes functions for running PoW for approving block of transactions
        - MerkleTree.py: Implements Merkle Tree for finding hash root of block of transactions
    + Step 3:
        - Block{0-4}.txt, ECC_Sample.py, PhaseIII_Test,py, transactions.txt were given by the assignment 
        - MerkleTree.py: Implements Merkle Tree for finding hash root of block of transactions
        - ECDSA.py: Implements Digital Signiture mechanism using Elliptic Curve
        - ChainGen.py: Returns new block using block candidate and PoW of previous block
